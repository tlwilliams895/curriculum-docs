Setting Up A New Module Site
============================

Prerequisites
-------------

Python
~~~~~~

Working with our Sphinx setup requires Python 3.5+.

Check your Python version:

::

   $ python -V
   Python 3.6.1 :: Continuum Analytics, Inc.

On some systems, Python 3 will be installed as ``python3``:

::

   $ python3 -V
   Python 3.6.5

.. note::

   If you are using ``python3``, you’ll need to use ``pip3`` wherever ``pip`` is used in the sections below.

If you don’t have a sufficient Python install, we recommend installing
`Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`__.

Sphinx Setup
------------

Install `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__:

::

   $ pip install sphinx==1.8.5

Install
`Recommonmark <https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ to
allow for writing of Markdown files in Sphinx:

::

   $ pip install recommonmark

Install the LaunchCode fork of the ``sphinx-bootstrap-theme`` Sphinx
theme.

::

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/sphinx-bootstrap-theme.git@master

Install pypandoc because if you don’t, you will see an error after
running build

::

   $ pip install pypandoc

Installing the theme for development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: 

   Only complete this step if you want to edit the theme for all sites. Otherwise, skip to the next section.

If you want to make changes to the theme, clone its `GitHub
repo <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/sphinx-bootstrap-theme>`__.
From the repository directory ``sphinx-bootstrap-theme/``, run:

::

   $ pip install -e .

This installs the Python package from the source contained in the cloned
repo.

Site Setup
----------

Clone the site template into a new directory:

::

   $ git clone git@github.com:LaunchCodeEducation/curriculum-module-template.git SITE_NAME

Alternatively, if you don’t have an SSH key configured for your GitHub
account, use HTTP:

::

   $ git clone http://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/curriculum-module-template SITE_NAME

Move into the new project directory. Make the module template repository
the new site’s ``upstream`` remote, for ease of updating the site when
the ``curriculum-module-template`` repository is updated:

::

   $ git remote rm origin
   $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:LaunchCodeEducation/curriculum-module-template.git

Or, with HTTP:

::

   $ git remote rm origin
   $ git remote add upstream http://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/curriculum-module-template

Create a new *empty* repository on GitHub, under
[@LaunchCodeEducation](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation) or
[@LaunchCoderGirl](https://github.com/LaunchCoderGirlSTL), as
appropriate. Add the new repo as a remote to your local repository, and
push:

::

   $ git remote add origin NEW_REPO_URL
   $ git push origin master

Building the site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now build the site and push, so we can configure GitHub Pages:

::

   $ ./build.sh
   Running Sphinx v1.7.2
   loading pickled environment... not yet created
   building [mo]: all of 0 po files
   building [html]: all source files
   updating environment: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 removed
   reading sources... [100%] index                                                                     
   looking for now-outdated files... none found
   pickling environment... done
   checking consistency... done
   preparing documents... done
   writing output... [100%] index                                                                      
   generating indices... genindex
   writing additional pages... search
   copying static files... done
   copying extra files... done
   dumping search index in English (code: en) ... done
   dumping object inventory... done
   build succeeded.

   The HTML pages are in docs.

If the build script fails due to a permissions error, enable its
executable bit:

::

   $ chmod +x build.sh

.. note:: 

   At this point, if you wish to view the site locally then follow the `instructions to set up a local HTTP preview server <//building/working.html#viewing-the-site-locally>`__.

Before you can commit, remove the following line from ``.gitignore``:

::

   docs/*

.. warning:: 

   At this point, it is very important to make sure you followed the directions above to point your ``origin`` remote at the right location.

After the build successfully completes, add and commit the built site.
You’ll have several new files and directories in this commit, since it
will be the first (and only) time many of the site’s static files are
moved into the ``/docs``, from which they’ll be served.

::

   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "Initial build"
   $ git push origin master

Publishing via GitHub Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the repository’s *Settings* page, enable GitHub Pages via the
``/docs`` directory.

.. figure:: /_static/images/enable-gh-pages.png
   :alt: Enable GitHub Pages

   Enable GitHub Pages

After a couple of minutes, you should be able to access the live site
via its GitHub Pages URL.

Site-specific settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the top of ``src/conf.py``, add your site-specific settings. Be sure
to at least configure:

-  Variables in ``site_theme_options``:

   -  ``navbar_title``: The site name that will appear in the navbar.
   -  ``navbar_site_name``: The title of the dropdown in the navbar that
      lists top-level site pages.
   -  ``bootswatch_theme``: Either ``launchcode`` or ``codergirl``,
      depending on the intended program for the module being published.

-  ``project``: The name of the curriculum module (e.g. "LaunchCode’s
   Liftoff")
-  If creating a site for CoderGirl, set
   ``html_logo = '_static/images/logos/codergirl-white.png'``

Updating the Theme or Styles
----------------------------

Occasionally the site’s theme or styles will be updated. We discuss how
to get and deploy such changes.

Updating site styles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update the site template (get changes to ``_static`` files,
``build.sh``, and other files from ``curriculum-module-template``),
fetch the upstream changes and merge them into the ``master`` branch.

::

   $ git fetch upstream
   $ git merge upstream/master

Then build the site, commit, and push.

When merging, be very mindful of merge conflicts. In particular,
conflicts in ``index.rst`` and ``conf.py`` are common. Additionally, you
may have conflicts in ``docs/`` (the build directory). To deal with
these, merge all other conflicts and rebuild the site. Also be watchful
for any new files added by this merge. The merge may bring in images or
``.rst`` files that are not used by your project.

Updating the site template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update the site’s template, update your local install of
``sphinx-bootstrap-template`` (``--upprade`` forces the package to be
downloaded again):

::

   $ pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/sphinx-bootstrap-theme.git@master

Then build the site, commit, and push.
